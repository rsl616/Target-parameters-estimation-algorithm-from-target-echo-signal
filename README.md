# Target-parameters-estimation-algorithm-from-target-echo-signal
An algorithm for estimating target delay-Doppler 2D parameters from target echo signals

The auto-ambiguity function of the transmit signal is calculated first, the sampling cross-ambiguity function is calculated based on the received and transmit signals, and then the estimation of the target reflectivity density function can be obtained by R-L deconvolution. The target reflectivity density function is calculated by iteration, and as the number of iterations increases, the main flap of the target reflectivity density function becomes obviously sharp and develops towards a two-dimensional impulse function of the peg type.
